TerminusDB is a open source graph database and document store. It is designed for collaboratively building data-intensive applications and knowledge graphs. If you want to collaborate with colleagues or build data-intensive applications, nothing will make you more productive. 

It is a native revision control database that is architecturally similar to Git and other distributed version control systems. 

TerminusDB provides a RESTful API for interacting via the JSON-LD exchange format. You can easily compose applications within your own toolchain which utilise the powerful features of TerminusDB.

<br/>

TerminusDB is a lightweight, high-speed immutable database. Our [delta-encoding](docs/whitepaper/terminusdb.pdf) approach makes branch, merge, push, pull, clone, time-travel and other git-like operations possible.

Data collaboration is facilitated through [TerminusHub](https://terminusdb.com/hub), which is a freemium service that allows users to manage access to databases and collaboratively work on shared resources. 

## Why TerminusDB


* Get started in minutes. Whatever language you're using or if you prefer our low-code console, TerminusDB is easy - you can have your database running in just a few minutes. And nothing will make you more productive
* Powerful query allow you to search for repeating patterns using recursion
* Generate forms, get data validation, and a flexible & surfable document interface (in console)
* Visual tool to build complex data models, which are easy, maintainable and enforced
* Data science/data engineering functionality directly in the database and via TerminusHub 
* Clone the production db, branch, merge, collaboration, lineage, versioning and time travel - Git-like revision control for large databases
* New paradigm in data-centric application development


## Getting Started

We encourage you to read our [Quick Start](https://terminusdb.com/docs/quickstart/) guide to better understand how to get started with TerminusDB.

Desktop versions of TerminusDB can be found in our [Download Center](https://terminusdb.com/hub/download)

For development and testing we recommend our [TerminusDB Bootstrap](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-bootstrap) installer, which uses the Docker image

### Building from source

In order to build from source, follow the [build from source](docs/BUILD.md) directions.

### Open Console

Once you have installed terminusdb-server either from the docker image or built from source you can enter the server location into your browser to view your database from the console "http://SERVER:PORT/". (the default is: https://127.0.0.1:6363/).

### Command Line

In order to start the terminusdb server or simply to explore a store
from the command line, you can use the [TerminusDB Command Line
Interface](docs/CLI.md).

## Client

In order to begin manipulating and querying your database you can
start the TerminusDB server (using the CLI) and then simply point your
browser to `"http://SERVER:PORT/"` which should allow you to manage
and query your database.

You can also perform all configuration, querying and management
functions via the RESTful API. We have a number of client libraries to
help you get started:

The [JavaScript client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client) give you
assistance with programatic access.

The [TerminusDB Console](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-dashboard) allows low-code manipulation of the database.

The [Python client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client-python) allows
you to use a pythonic syntax to query the database.

## Documentation

In order to use your TerminusDB through the console rather than
directly through clients you should look at the documentation on our
[TerminusDB documentation](https://terminusdb.com/documentation/) website.
